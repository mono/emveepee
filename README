emveepee is a user interface for executing applications with the mono logging 
profiler and viewing the result of logging profiler sessions.  The package 
provides both a standalone Gtk# application (emveepee) and a MonoDevelop 
addin (Emveepee.Addin.dll).

This package is currently highly unstable, and builds upon unstable mono 
versions and is therefore not recommended for widespread use, though any who
are daring enough to want to try are welcome to report any issues via 
bugzilla.novell.com module Mono Tools component emveepee.

Discussion occurs on mono-devel-list@lists.ximian.com.

Building:
--------

    ./configure [typical configure flags, such as --prefix=PREFIX]
    make
    make install

When building from svn, substitute autogen.sh for configure.
